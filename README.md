# CleverConvo: Multimodal Text Wizard

CleverConvo is an AI-powered multimodal conversational solution that combines text, audio, and image-based interactions to facilitate natural and intelligent conversations. It leverages state-of-the-art technologies like CNN, LSTM, and Google's APIs to enable features such as image description, language translation, recommendation engines, sentiment analysis, and content generation.

This project was developed using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Python Django** for the backend, integrating Googleâ€™s APIs for advanced AI functionalities.

## Installation

Follow these steps to fork and set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 16+**
- **npm 8+** or **yarn**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Git**

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cleverconvo.git
   cd cleverconvo
   ```

2. **Set Up the Backend (Django)**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Configure the database in `cleverconvo/settings.py` (update the `DATABASES` section with your PostgreSQL credentials).
   - Apply migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend (React.js)**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Ensure `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are present in the directory.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install  # Or: yarn install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start  # Or: yarn start
     ```

4. **Set Up Google Cloud APIs**
   - Create a Google Cloud project and enable APIs (Vision API, Translation API, etc.).
   - Download the credentials JSON file and place it in the `backend` directory.
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials.json"
     ```

## Usage

1. Open the frontend in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Use the various features like image description, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
3. The backend runs at `http://localhost:8000` and handles API requests.
